## Building & Running

To build or run the project, use one of the following tasks:

| Task                          | Description                                                          |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `./gradlew test`              | Run the tests                                                        |
| `./gradlew build`             | Build everything                                                     |
| `buildFatJar`                 | Build an executable JAR of the server with all dependencies included |
| `buildImage`                  | Build the docker image to use with the fat JAR                       |
| `publishImageToLocalRegistry` | Publish the docker image locally                                     |
| `run`                         | Run the server                                                       |
| `runDocker`                   | Run using the local docker image                                     |

If the server starts successfully, you'll see the following output:

```
2024-12-04 14:32:45.584 [main] INFO  Application - Application started in 0.303 seconds.
2024-12-04 14:32:45.682 [main] INFO  Application - Responding at http://0.0.0.0:8080
```

### IDEAS

- Add tests
- Using Exposed: Exposed is a lightweight SQL library on top of a JDBC driver for the Kotlin programming language.
Cose to use the DSL 
- try out a try / catch style controller
- Add another datasource to check that one can, in fact have two datasources in Exposed.  (JWT)
- Ephemeral/Disposable Test DB. Used when running tests in application. ( full integration test )
- Add logging, especially the exceptions and write to log output file. 

```kotlin
post {
    try {
        val task = call.receive<Task>()
        repository.addTask(task)
        call.respond(HttpStatusCode.NoContent)
    } catch (ex: IllegalStateException) {
        call.respond(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest)
    } catch (ex: JsonConvertException) {
        call.respond(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest)
    }
}
```

### Differences from spring boot:

- Ktor ( without dependency injection ) does not rely on annotations like `@Controller` `@Bean` etc. It follows a
  declarative and compositional style,
  where we explicitly register features like routing by extending the Application
  function (`Application.installRoutes()`).
- Ktor handles Serialization through the `ContentNegotiation` plugin. Instead of wrapping the response in
  a `ResponseEntity` class, the http responses
  are created directly through the 
- StatusPages plugin (Ktorâ€™s global error handler)
